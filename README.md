### Additionally
I did not change all UI (save/load, etc.).

### Bugs that I know about:
The settings menu does not update when you change the language. </br>
On 4:3 screen sizes, the map icon is off-screen. </br>
In Ukrainian there are some characters that are not displayed. </br>
The quest log is not translating. </br>
In non-English localisations, sometimes the text goes outside the borders. </br>
